As the train was approaching Abergele, three miles ahead in Llanddulas goods trucks were being shunted on the main line.  This usually took place without problem, except on this day there were other goods wagons in the way, filling the sidings.  This left six trucks and a brake van on the main line.  Some of the trucks from the sidings were shunted onto the main line causing them all to begin rolling down the hill.  Two of the trucks carried fifty barrels of paraffin.  The Irish Mail could not see the wagons coming until it was too late.  As there was no telegraph connection between Abergele and Llanddulas, the Irish Mail could not have been told.  33 people died.","http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/abergele/pages/traindisaster.shtml;  Hume, Robert, 2004.

'Nimrod' is towed from Lyttelton, New Zealand by the steamer 'Koonya', as far as the Antarctic Circle.  Winter quarters were established at Cape Royds on Ross Island, and 'Nimrod' returned to New Zealand.

Although the expedition was unsuccessful in its aim - Shackleton reluctantly decided to turn back, when he was within 100 miles of the South Pole – it made some great achievements.  First, this was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole.  Secondly, they had successfully ascended and surveyed Mount Erebus (12,448 feet), the active volcano on Ross Island.  Thirdly, due largely to Shackleton’s leadership skills there was no loss of life.  Fourthly, was Shackleton’s prompt publishing of the expedition narrative - ‘The Heart of the Antarctic’ - within a couple of months of his return.",ODNB: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36034; WIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition,,BRITISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION (1907-1909)

As a way of incentive, the directors offered a £500 prize to the winner.
