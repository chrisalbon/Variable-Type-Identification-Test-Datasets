6.762085,"On 15 August 2009, representatives from the Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) visited Edagberi community in Rivers State, Nigeria, to investigate reports of continuous oil spills in the area.

Edagberi community, also known as Joinkrama 4 (or simply JK4) is in the Ahoada West Local Government Area of Rivers State. The area has 44 oil wells in the Adibawa oil field operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).

Between 2006 and 2009, Edagberi and the surrounding land has suffered no fewer than 16 oil spillages, making it one of the worst oil impacted communities in the Niger Delta.

The aging pipelines that criss-cross the jungle landscape struggle to cope with the high pressure of oil being pumped through them with disastrous consequences for the community.","Continuous Oil Spills in Edagberi Community and Ineffectual Cleanup Operations",1,1,1,4.94867,"Rivers State, Nigeria","2009-08-15 12:00:00",14,14

The community is host to a number of oil servicing companies including the Shell Petroleum Development Company. Despite its status as an oil producing community, Otuasega is seriously impoverished and things are getting worse.

Regular oil spills pour crude into farmland and into the surrounding rivers causing serious damage to the environment to the livelihood of local people.

As the crop yields decline due to continual environmental pollution, the incidence of poverty has risen as many local farmers can no longer grow enough food.","Life in Otuasega",1,1,1,4.94867,"Otuasega, Ogbia Local Government Area, Bayelsa State.","2009-11-18 12:00:00",17,17
6.264167,"Biseni is one of the many communities in Bayelsa that has been blessed with abundant natural resources. It has eight clusters of oil wells operated jointly by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) and Shell's Petroleum Development Company (SPDC). The wells have been in operation in the area since 1972. 

Biseni is a typical example of the thousands of communities in the oil producing Niger Delta. After more than 35 years of oil exploration on their doorstep the people of Biseni live without drinking water, which often makes them sick. And when they get sick they have no proper health care facilities.

The thing about Biseni is that it is not a forgotten village. The Bayelsa State Governor with the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC - a government agency entrusted with using the proceeds of the oil wealth to develop local communities) supposedly completed a much trumped surface water scheme at the end of 2008. It was never finished, and the people of Biseni feel tricked.","35 Years of Oil Exploration in Biseni",1,1,1,4.924722,"Yenagoa, Bayelsa State","2009-07-01 12:00:00",18,18

The permanent oil spillage in Bomu is clearly visible around the Bondimpa Fishing Port and all along the creek. Community Leaders blame the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) for the oil spillage and say that most of the pipes carrying oil to the ocean terminal are damaged and pour out crude into the creek and surrounding farmlands.

This is not the first time that Bomu has been affected by Shell; The most recent oil spillage in Bomu occurred in September 2008. According to the community the spill was caused by a leakage at nearby Bodo which poured crude oil into the creek which, in turn, flowed downstream to Bomu.","Swimming in Crude - Bomu Community",1,1,1,4.640761,"Bomu, Gokana Local Government Area, Ogoni Land","2009-06-01 12:00:00",19,19

7.218018,"On 28 August 2008 a fault in the Trans-Niger pipeline resulted in a significant oil spill into Bodo Creek in Ogoniland. The oil poured into the swamp and creek for weeks, covering the area in a thick slick of oil and killing the fish that people depend on for food and for their livelihood.

A local NGO, the Center for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD), which investigated the case (including by taking video footage of the leak), reported that the oil spill has resulted in death or damage to a number of species of fish that provide the protein needs of the local community.

Video footage of the site shows widespread damage, including to mangroves which are an important fish breeding ground.

The pipe that burst is the responsibility of the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC). The community claim that the spill began on 28 August 2008. SPDC has reportedly stated that the spill was only reported to them on 5 October of that year. Rivers State Ministry of Environment was informed of the leak and its devastating consequences on 12 October by CEHRD. A Ministry official is reported to have visited the site on 15 October. However, the leak was not stopped until 7 November.

In October 2008, members of the community said they were desperate for action to stop the leak that was destroying their food source and environment.","Oil Spill at Bodo Creek",1,0,1,4.620229,"Bodo","2008-08-28 05:19:00",44,44

According to Chief Kabri Kabri, Shell representatives who inspected the leak found three holes in the underside of the pipe which they attributed to corrosion. Shell clamped the pipeline and mechanically removed much of the spilled oil. Almost a year later, Shell had taken no further action to clean up the site or compensate the affected community. When questioned by Amnesty International, Shell had changed their assessment and claimed the spill was due to sabotage.

It is shocking to see that Shell is being permitted to construct a new gas flare furnace when they ought to be shutting down existing flare sites.

7.272949,"On June 16, 2008 oil spilled at SPDC Well 18 situated at Kpor, the headquarters of Gokana local government area.  SPDC responded by deploying Dok Liaison Agency*, one of its local contracting firms to contain the spilling oil from extensive spreading. Foot workers of Dok Liaison dug four 2x2x2m ponds along the tract that the oozing oil flows.  Accumulated oil in the dugout pits was never scoop away.  Consequently, an overnight post-spill/containment rainfall led to overflow of the ditches.

Tidal regimes have caused wide-spread distribution of oil scum to the length and breadth of Bodo Creek and the network of adjoining Creeks.  Toxicity of the oil has resulted in mortal damages to food species that support the protein needs of the people.  These include Oyster (Crassostrea gasar), bloody cockle (Anadara senilis), Swimming Crab (Callinectis spp), fiddler crab (Uca tangeri), mangrove hairy crab (Gionopsis Pelli), mudskipper (Periopthalmus papilio), Mullets (Mugil cephalus, Liza spp), Snapper (Lutjanaus spp), etc. Carcasses of these and other species are visibly washed ashore or found afloat in the creek waters and on attached substrates.  Marginal macrophytes are badly affected too.  Mangroves (mostly red mangrove, Rhizophora spp and white mangrove, Avicennia germinas) dominate the creek floristic community.  These are tainted and have started showing signs of death and defoliation; some mangrove stands are dead already.  

At present however, the actual lethal and sublethal (i.e. both short and long term) impacts of the spillage cannot be estimated.  Secondly, the spill continues and the effects on the biophysical environment will increase in several folds as the oil exudation protracts.

State.

The Bonny terminal currently has over 12 million barrel of crude oil storage capacity and is also the biggest export terminal in Nigeria. It has a helicopter landing pad and facilities capable of loading super
tankers – in addition to an indoor berthing facility that can take six ocean going tankers, an expatriate club, a residential area, amongst others.

Recently, the entire shoreline of Ibeno local government area which runs into several kilometres adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean was devastated by oil spill from the activities of oil producing companies operating offshore. Among the oil companies operating offshore Akwa Ibom include Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) operator of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC/MPN) joint venture, Afren, former Addax and Mono Poli. It is not the first time that the oil bearing communities of the state had been hit by oil spill, but this time around, a new twist that has crept into the incident is the denial of responsibility by the oil companies.
